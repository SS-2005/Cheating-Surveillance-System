# Cheating-Surveillance
This project detects cheating by tracking head and pupil movements using the Shape Predictor 68 facial landmarks. It also detects mobile phones with a YOLO model trained on the Roboflow cellphone detection dataset. Designed for real-time monitoring, it helps prevent cheating by analyzing facial cues and unauthorized device usage.
